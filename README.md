# Frontend Interview Challenges

Welcome to my **Frontend Interview Challenges** repository! This repository contains a series of coding challenges and projects designed to help prepare for frontend interviews. I will be solving various problems using **React**, **JavaScript**, and other modern web technologies.

Each challenge includes explanations, code walkthroughs, and useful insights gained through solving the problems. This repo serves as a personal learning journey and a portfolio of frontend interview preparation.

## ðŸ“š Challenges Included

This repo covers a wide range of frontend interview challenges that will help you practice and prepare for real-world coding interviews. The main areas include:

- **React Development** (Functional components, hooks, state management)
- **JavaScript** (DOM manipulation, algorithms, arrays, and more)
- **CSS** (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)
- **Frontend Architecture** (Component design, state management)
